# Load Test Driven Development (LTDD)

Our testing methodology affects our architecture. We have considered performance from day 1. After years of Test Driven Development we are now introducing a Load Test Driven Development approach, performing Load Tests continuously instead of as an afterthought.

In our vision load tests should guide us in building the architecture and the app, highlighting possible performance issues while introducing new features to Belfrage.
