# Diagram source files

## Drawio

Store the `.drawio` files here in order to allow users to open and edit them directly in VSCode. This requires the [Draw.io extension](https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio) to be installed first.

To create the SVG files, go to `File > Export > SVG` and save the file to the img directory.
