### Our review process 🔎 
We'll review the open feature requests on an ad-hoc basis, and discuss them within the Belfrage team. If we decide to take an action on the feature request, we'll open a JIRA ticket and share the link to that ticket on the feature request issue.

Feel free to share links to new feature requests with us in the [Help Belfrage](https://bbc-dpg.slack.com/messages/help-belfrage) slack channel
