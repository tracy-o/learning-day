# Load Test Results -  Belfrage performance investigation

## Context

During the first spike for Belfrage 2nd tier cache, load tests were conducted with Belfrage cache-busting feature, to gauge the performance implication of payload messaging between Elixir nodes. Further tests are impeded by the [performance of Belfrage at higher rate](https://broxy.tools.bbc.co.uk/belfrage-loadtest-results/vegeta-60s-350rps-1581958285990).

#### 350rps performance,  17 Feb
![Performance at 350rps](img/2020-02-18/performance_2020_02_17.png)


## Hypothesis

- The performance degradation has been introduced by a recent merge.

## Setup
- Vegeta Runner on EC2
- Requests to Belfrage playground: cache busting on or cache-control ("private, max-age=0, no-cache")
- OriginSimulator on EC2: Type: 1 x c5.2xlarge instance, CPUs: 8 vCPUs (4 core, 2 threads per core)
- OriginSimulator simulate 300kb payload (random_content recipe)

## Tests
Run `60s, 350rps, 0ms latency` test on the following selected Belfrage builts (date):

## Results

Positive: the performance degradation has been introduced by a recent [merge on 4 Feb 2020](https://github.com/bbc/belfrage/commit/a819725c2c8d7e5d565541bfbca4065402486ca3).
