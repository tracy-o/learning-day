## Belfrage metrics and analysis

The main objective of this loadtest was to confirm the following sequence of events.

1. A high number of requests is sent to an origin, each of which taking a long time (>= 1s).
2. The worker pool processing those requests gets drained.
3. Circuit Breaker triggers, stopping any request to that origin.

We confirmed the spike in requests:

Which drained the worker pool:

After the worker pool gets drained, the circuit breaker triggered at 11:18

Memory and CPU behaved like so:

At one point, we started serving fallbacks as well:

![Private Responses](./img/2023-04-26/BelfrageResponsesPrivate.png)

Finally, it is worth mentioning that there is a discrepancy in the worker timeout_limit, which is set to 5s, and the actual maximum checkout duration, closer to 8.3s. A ticket has been created to analyse this further.

Another load test was run, with the the `pool_timeout` set to 2 seconds and the `:caching_enabled` set to `false` for the `ProxyPass` RouteSpec.
The diff for the above is [here](https://github.com/bbc/belfrage/compare/6263bd1db...3cde7422f).

We observed reduced latencies and pool checkout durations:
