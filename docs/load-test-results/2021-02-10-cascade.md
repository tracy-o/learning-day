# Cascade load test check

This load tests the Cascade service in Belfrage to check in case there are any performance issues introduced since it was originally developed last year.

A new private route was created for this test `_private/lambda-cascade-test`. This route is defined as a Cascade route where it first makes a request to the Lambda and then, if there is a 404, a request is made to The ProxyPass (Origin Simulator). A new Lambda function was added which returns 404s with a fixed timeout of 500ms `empty-404-timeout`.

## Instance

- Type: 1 x c5.2xlarge
- CPUs: 8 vCPUs (4 core, 2 threads per core)
- OriginSimulator on EC2: c5.2xlarge instance, CPUs: 8 vCPUs

## Tests

All tests run with the 60s 400rps recipe.

## Conclusion

In each of the load tests the latency values appear very consistent. There is a very low overhead introduced by Belfrage and the cascade logic so there does not look to be any performance regressions. The overall latency is of course much higher when a request is required to cascade versus a request that does not require to cascade.
