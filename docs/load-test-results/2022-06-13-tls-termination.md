# TLS Termination Loadtest Report

The purpose of the loadtest is to measure the performance differences between terminating tls connection on the load balancer as we currently do and terminating the tls connection on the instance.

## ;TLDR
Terminating tls on the instance is much less performant.
- When using on instance tls termination we can reach between 3000-3200 rps
- When using tls termination from the load balancer (without client side verification) you can comfortably reach over 10000 rps.

## Loadtest Configuration
Loadtest Instance:
- Instance Type: c5.9xlarge 

Belfrage Instance:
- Instance Type: c5.2xlarge

Belfage Endpoint:
- `/status`

## Loadtests with Instance TLS Termination
- Stack: www test Belfrage stack
- Branch:  `RESFRAME-4686-instance-tls-termination-loadtest` `07032f3b0d7d189db160c0cdc4fc22222eb23f73`
- Using this branch you can only access Belfrage with a client certificate
- The stack was set to only have 1 instance and not to scale

Its not clear what is causing the application to become overloaded. When we look at the CPU metrics we can see that in the most extreme cases only around 60% of CPU is being used.

![CPU for 3000rps 60s loadtest](./img/2022-06-13-tls-termination/tls_term_3000rps_cpu.png)

Also analysing the latency over the course of the loadtests show that suggests there is some underlying issue causing latency spikes. There is often a single 500 which leads to a latency spike which is more pronounced the higher the load.

![Shows small spikes after 500](./img/2022-06-13-tls-termination/tls_term_3100rps_plot.png)

[see interactively](./data/2022-06-13-tls-termination/tls_term_3200rps_plot.html)

When the load test completely fails (around 5% success ratio) we can see that there is some kind of ceiling that is reached at the 3 second mark. Its not clear what is causing this. (I'm open to suggestions) but the behaviour in general looks very erratic and strange.

Here you can see that when not verifying client certificate. **The performance doesn't start to degrade until we reach 15,000rps** and even then it degrades somewhat more gracefully.

[see interactively](./data/2022-06-13-tls-termination/test_master_10000rps_plot.html)

but when we hit 15,000rps the load can't be handled so well.

[see interactively](./data/2022-06-13-tls-termination/test_master_15000rps_plot.html)


## Comparing the Loadtests and Future Work
We can comfortably reach 3000rps with tls termination on the instance with client side verification. We can handle at least 10,000rps when we terminate tls on the instance. **So terminating tls on the instance without client side verification is over 3x more performant.**

Also its interesting to see that CPU isn't the bottleneck on performance as even in the most extreme instance terminating loadtests reached 60% CPU usage. So there must be another bottleneck.

Future work could include:
- Finding out what causes the slowdown peer verifying client side certificates or terminating on the instance.
- Also loadtesting Belfrage with an nginx instance in-front to terminate the instance in a more performant way.
- Look deeper into understanding what the bottleneck is with instance termination if its not the CPU
