# TLS Termination Loadtest Report

The purpose of these loadtests is to measure the performance differences between:
- terminating TLS connections on the load balancer (as we currently do)
- terminating TLS connections on the instance
- terminating TLS connections on the instance while also verifying client certificates

## ;TLDR
Terminating TLS on the instance is much less performant.

Highest rps achieved, when using TLS termination:
- On the Load Balancer
    - over 10000rps
- On the instance (with client peer verification)
    - 3200rps
- On the instance (no client peer verification)
    - 3800rps

From this we can see that TLS termination on the load balancer is at least 2x faster than the other options.

## Loadtest Configuration
Loadtest Instance:
- Instance Type: c5.9xlarge 

Belfrage Instance:
- Instance Type: c5.2xlarge

Belfage Endpoint:
- `/status`

## Loadtests with TLS Termination on the Load Balancer
- Stack: cedric test Belfrage stack
- Branch:  `master` `c911c3011d019f7370f55fdc51f09a35a54ddcbc`
- Using this branch you can access cedric belfrage just with a url (no certs)
- The stack was set to only have 1 instance and not to scale

Here you can see that when not verifying client certificate. **The performance doesn't start to degrade until we reach 15,000rps** and even then it degrades somewhat more gracefully.

but when we hit 15,000rps the load can't be handled so well.

Its not clear what is causing the application to become overloaded. When we look at the CPU metrics we can see that in the most extreme cases only around 60% of CPU is being used.

See the CPU for the 3000rps 60s loadtest below.
![CPU for 3000rps 60s loadtest](./img/2022-06-13-tls-termination/tls_term_3000rps_cpu.png)

Also analysing the latency over the course of the loadtests suggests there is some underlying issue causing latency spikes. There is often a single 500 which leads to a latency spike which is more pronounced the higher the load.

3200rps 60s, notice the scale is different because of some freak 500s with 30s latency.
For more detail view the interactive version in the link under the graph.

[see interactively](./data/2022-06-13-tls-termination/tls_term_3200rps_plot.html)

When the load test completely fails (when success ratio is below 5%) we can see that there is some kind of ceiling that is reached at the 30 second mark. Its not clear what is causing this. (I'm open to suggestions) but the behaviour in general looks very erratic and strange.

I also did the same test using using `-http2 false` argument, just to check if there was a significant difference. There wasn't, it broke at 3900rps just like the other setup.

Looking to the latency graphs we also see behaviour similar to the previous loadtests with peer verification. The loadtest doesn't seem cpu bound as the CPU reaches around 60% usage with 3800rps. We also see the familiar spikes after a 500, just like with the peer verification load tests. The breaking behaviour is almost identical, so it seems to be breaking the same way.

## Comparing the Loadtests and Future Work
To summarise the max request per second reached in each scenario:
- Terminating TLS on the Load Balancer
    - 10,000 rps (at least)
- Terminating TLS on the instance (with client peer verification)
    - 3200 rps
- Terminating TLS on the instance (no client peer verification)
    - 3800 rps

**So terminating TLS on the Load Balancer is over 2x more performant.**

Also its interesting to see that CPU isn't the bottleneck on performance as even in the most extreme instance terminating loadtests reached 60% CPU usage. So there must be another bottleneck.

Its also clear that using peer verification does impact performance. However the greater performance is due to the termination of TLS on the instance.

Future work could include:
- Loadtesting Belfrage with an nginx instance in-front to terminate the TLS connection in a more performant way.
- Look deeper into understanding what the bottleneck is with TLS termination on the instance if its not the CPU.
