# Load Tests: Tier-1 cache fallback performance

## Context

We want to verify the performance and the resiliency of the in-memory fallback mechanism from Tier-1 cache - [RESFRAME-3069](https://jira.dev.bbc.co.uk/browse/RESFRAME-3069).

## Hypothesis

- Belfrage T1 cache provides fallback mechanism and 100% performant when HTTP origin is down

## Setup
- Vegeta Runner on EC2
- Belfrage (playground) on EC2: Type: 1 x c5.2xlarge instance, CPUs: 8 vCPUs (4 core, 2 threads per core)
  - master branch: 10 March, commit: 388cf32da572fd356dfad8c25938dc58b08d678f
- Requests to Belfrage playground, to an OriginSimulator route.
- OriginSimulator on EC2: Type: 1 x c5.2xlarge instance, CPUs: 8 vCPUs (4 core, 2 threads per core)
- OriginSimulator simulates HTTP 20kb gzipped content payload (`random_content` recipe)

## Tests
Run the following tests on https://www.belfrage-playground.test.api.bbc.co.uk/sounds with a simulated origin containing 20kb gzip random content

1. `60s, 200rps` test, origin with HTTP status 200, 0ms latency
2. `1200s, 200rps` test, origin (down) with HTTP status 500, 500ms latency
3. `1200s, 400rps` test, origin (down) with HTTP status 500, 500ms latency

## Results

Belfrage T1 cache provides fallback mechanism and 100% performant when HTTP origin is down.

The results suggests T1 cache working as expected and provides the fallback with minimal added latency (4-5ms). The server performance was CPU-bound: towards **45% max usage** at 400rps. Memory usage was within the range of 2-5% of 15Gb, max usage 4.7%, 0.7Gb.

#### Server performance: CloudWatch

Note: the initial counts of `web.response.status.500` were the results of manual checking that origin is down (via `cache bust`)
