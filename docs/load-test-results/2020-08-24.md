# Testing the impact of tooling dependencies

- 24th - 25th Auguest 2020
- [Empty response Lambda](https://empty-response.belfrage-playground.test.api.bbc.co.uk/)
- Load test recipes 200 - 1000rps
- Repeater for 30 min runs
- Baseline tests without Observer CLI installed
- Tests with Observer CLI installed
- Tests with Observer CLI installed and connected (observing the output in the terminal)
- Vegeta

## Summary

The impact on response times when the observer_cli was enabled on the Playground was very slight. The mean latency for the 1000rps test was 51.366449ms versus 51.139589ms and the 99th percentile was 97.524352ms versus 97.190578ms. This looked to be consistenct across all the loadtests that were run.

The memory usage was minimal across all runs.

The CPU usage charts showed that there is a relatively noticeable impact on the instance when the observer_cli was enabled. During the 1000rps test the cpu usage was ~93% versus ~79%. The variance does not appear to be consistent for the different load tests however the CPU usage was always noticeably impacted by the observer_cli.

The additional test run with the observer_cli enabled but not started shows that there was still an impact on performance. This suggests that starting the observer_cli had little impact.

The repeater traffic showed a slightly different story and it is more difficult to see the impact. The traffic patterns for the two runs are not consistent however as the second run has a lower request count for a portion of the test at the start. Comparing the 2nd run from 14:10 UTC versus the 1st run it does show the observer_cli impacted the CPU usage, albeit only slightly.

In conclusion, when enabled, the observer_cli may impact CPU usage to some extent but it is reasonably small and is not impacted adversely when starting it on an instance. Using live traffic showed that it had less of an impact compared to when load test were run.

Microstate Accounting had a slight impact on latency. During the 200rps test the mean was 46.485357ms versus 44.431828ms and the 99th percentile was 112.257641ms versus 107.767342ms. The CPU usage did not appear to be impacted to any noticeable degree (on the repeater test the traffic appears to have dropped significantly during the data collection time unfortunately).
