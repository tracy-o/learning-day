We use [`MachineGun`](https://github.com/petrohi/machine_gun) to make requests to origins. It maintains a pool of workers per host/port pair and uses [`poolboy`](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy) behind the scenes. `poolboy` allows to configure a number of "overflow" workers, which are one-off workers that are started to process a request when the main pool is empty. `MachineGun` establishes HTTP connections lazily on the first request.
